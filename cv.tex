\section*{Employment}

\paragraph*{2022--today} \textbf{Masters dissertation supervisor}. In this role I am guiding a student on their first novel-research: \emph{modelling vacancy-cluster stability}. This involves bi-weekly meetings, reviewing their work and steering them towards a publication-quality dissertation. 

\paragraph*{2020--today}

I am entering my third year as an \textbf{undergraduate mathematics supervisor} at the University of Cambridge. This requires me to set, mark and teach eight students every week. This year one of my students ranked $2\textsuperscript{nd}$ across all the Cambridge colleges. Feedback has included: ``[Conor] pushed me to see the deep-connections between the topics we studied and always had the most (frustratingly!) elegant solutions''. 

\paragraph*{2020-2021} While holding a senior role on the Churchill College MCR as the Bar Secretary I: transformed the bar's stock list; negotiated extended opening hours and recruited and trained one of the largest cohorts of staff in recent years. I was required to plan-ahead, work diplomatically and assertively with the MCR team and communicating with Senior College leadership.

\section*{Software projects - available on \href{https://github.com/ConorWilliams}{ GitHub \faGithub}}

\paragraph*{2022--today} I am currently undertaking the open-sourcing and documentation of my PhD codebase, the first open off-lattice kinetic Monte Carlo framework. 

\paragraph*{2021} Developed and maintained C++ implementations of concurrent data-structures and a lock-free continuation-stealing scheduler as part of my journey to understand parallel/asynchronous programming and memory models.

\paragraph*{2021} As the MCR Computing Officer I designed and maintained a digital room-ballot system for the College, attempting to solve the \emph{assignment problem}.

\paragraph*{2018} Developed an optimisation algorithm in Python for eWATERservices to position water taps in African villages, which formed part of their successful World Bank investment bid. 

\section*{Technical skills}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
    \item \textbf{Coding:} C++ (advanced); Python \&  Git (intermediate); MATLAB$\text{\textregistered}$ \& CUDA (basic).
    \item \textbf{Operating systems:} Linux, Windows.
    \item \textbf{Software/Libraries:} \LaTeX, Eigen, Sphinx, Doxygen, Microsoft Office.
    \item \textbf{Presentations:} I regularly give engaging and informative talks to my non-expert industrial sponsors. Alongside, clear and precise technical-presentations to my research group and department.
          
\end{itemize}

\section*{Interests}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
    \item I am an avid ultralight-backpacker - completing multiple forty-day plus expeditions, carrying the minimum amount of equipment. These require extended planning and high self-motivation.
          
    \item I have rowed competitively for my college for four years, training as much as five times a week. This demonstrates my commitment and time management.
          
    \item I am an accomplished dinghy sailor; qualified Day Skipper; active member of the CUYC yacht club; amateur runner and surfer. These hobbies have taught me to work as a team in high-pressured environments.
