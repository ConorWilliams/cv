\section*{Industry}

\paragraph*{Summer 2023} Machine learning intern at \textbf{Myrtle.ai}. I developed a custom LSTM module in CUDA to replace a pytorch implementation. This formed a key component of their FPGA automatic speech recognition pipeline. I \textbf{delivered a solution that was $7.7\times$ faster} than their previous implementation and throughput competitive with NVIDIA's hand-tuned CuDNN library. Furthermore, during my time there I identified several stages in the memory constraining section of the model training pipeline that could be optimized; ultimately I increased the training batch size by $85\%$ which reduced training times/costs by a similar fraction. Finally, I implemented the transducer Multi-blank extension and trained a model with competitive word-error-rates whilst \textbf{halving inference-time latency}.

\section*{Other employment}

\paragraph*{2022--2023} \textbf{Masters dissertation supervisor}. In this role I guided a student on their first novel-research: \emph{modelling vacancy-cluster stability}. This involved bi-weekly meetings, reviewing their work and steering them towards a publication-quality dissertation. They achieved the \textbf{highest-grade in their cohort} and won the departmental prize for this work.

\paragraph*{2020--2023}

I have taught for three year as an \textbf{undergraduate mathematics supervisor} at the University of Cambridge. This requires me to set, mark and teach eight students every week. This year one of my students ranked $2\textsuperscript{nd}$ across all the Cambridge colleges. Feedback has included: ``[Conor] pushed me to see the deep-connections between the topics we studied and always had the most (frustratingly!) elegant solutions''. 

\paragraph*{2020-2021} While holding a senior role on the Churchill College MCR as the Bar Secretary I: transformed the bar's stock list; negotiated extended opening hours and recruited and trained one of the largest cohorts of staff in recent years. I was required to plan-ahead, work diplomatically and assertively with the MCR team and communicating with Senior College leadership.

\section*{Software projects - available on \href{https://github.com/ConorWilliams}{ GitHub \faGithub}}

\paragraph*{2022--today} I am currently undertaking the open-sourcing and documentation of my PhD codebase, the first open off-lattice kinetic Monte Carlo framework. 

\paragraph*{2021--today} Developed and maintain C++ implementations of concurrent data-structures and a lock-free \textbf{continuation-stealing scheduler} (utilizing C++20's coroutines) as part of my journey to understand parallel/asynchronous programming and memory models.

\paragraph*{2021} As the MCR Computing Officer I designed and maintained a digital room-ballot system for the College, attempting to solve \emph{the assignment problem}.

\paragraph*{2018} Developed an optimisation algorithm in Python for eWATERservices to position water taps in African villages, which formed part of their successful World Bank investment bid.

\section*{Interests}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
    \item I am an avid ultralight-backpacker - completing multiple $40+$ day expeditions, carrying the minimum amount of equipment. These require extended planning and high self-motivation.
          
    \item I have rowed competitively for my college for four years, training as much as five times a week. This demonstrates my commitment and time management.
          
    \item I am an accomplished dinghy sailor; qualified Day Skipper; active member of the CUYC yacht club; amateur runner and surfer. These hobbies have taught me to work as a team in high-pressured environments.
